* Report and resolve the violation

[[labexercises]]

=== Access the Student VM via SSH

The student VM host serves as an important access point into the environment, so you must ensure you can connect to it.

*Requirements* 

* *The ssh address for the bastion host:* 
** For example, 'lab-user@bastion.4klh8.sandbox1150.opentlc.com' 
* *The username and password for the Linux student VM (lab-user)*

[NOTE]
This information will be available in the services tab at link:https://demo.redhat.com/[demo.redhat.com^]. Or in the lab provisioning email.

.Procedure

.1. Connect to your student VM host using the command and password you received in the provisioning email:

*Sample command*
[source,bash]
----
ssh lab-user@bastion.<$GUID>.<$BASEDOMAIN>
----
*Sample output*
[source,bash]
----
The authenticity of host' bastion.4klh8.sandbox1150.opentlc.com (3.134.153.6)' cant be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:g0H5C1vP1xNqhL7fp0HxMRDPgjgzuAdi3ZIyKQl1mPU.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
----
.2. Verify that the GUID variable is set correctly for your environment:

*Sample command*
[source,bash]
----
echo $GUID
----
*Sample output*
[source,bash]
----
c3po
----

[NOTE]
Your GUID may be a 4- or 5-character alphanumeric string.


== Test Log4Shell Policy

In this lab, you demonstrate how to quickly stop workloads with `log4shell` vulnerabilities from deploying using Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS).
You also learn how to locate workloads with `log4shell`.

The Log4Shell policy is a build- and deployment-time policy.
It analyses the image file for vulnerable Java(TM) Log4J versions.


=== Deploy Vulnerable Image

Use `tmux` to watch OpenShift^(R)^ `events` while running the test, so you can see how RHACS enforces the policy at runtime.

.Procedure
. On your student VM, start `tmux` with two panes:
+
[source,sh]
----
tmux new-session \; split-window -v \; attach
----
+
. Run a watch on OpenShift events in the first pane's shell:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get events -w
----
+
. Type `Ctrl-b o` to switch to the next pane.
. Create a namespace to manage your deployment:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc new-project log4shell
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
Already on project "log4shell" on server "https://api.cluster-f82tm.f82tm.sandbox1350.opentlc.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
----
+
. Deploy the vulnerable application.
.. Create a Deployment manifest file:
+
[source,sh]
----
cat << EOF >deploy.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: log4shell
  namespace: log4shell
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      deployment: log4shell
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        deployment: log4shell
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/gpte-devops-automation/log4shell-vuln-app:v0.1.1
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: log4shell
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
        terminationMessagePolicy: File
      restartPolicy: Always
EOF
----
+
.. Create the Deployment based on the manifest file:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f ./deploy.yaml
----

Notice the application was deployed without issues. 

=== Check for vulnerability in ACS dashboard. 

It is now possible to see the Log4Shell vulnerability in the ACS dashboard.

.Procedure
. In the ACS dashboard, navigate to *Violations*

Notice `Log4Shell: log4j Remote Code Execution vulnerability` is now visible in the violations list. 

. Click on the `Log4Shell: log4j Remote Code Execution vulnerability` to get more information on the violation. 

. Click on the *Deployment* tab to view information about the vulnerable deployment. 

. Click on the *Policy* tab to view the current policy. 

. Delete the log4shell deployment: 
[source,sh]
----
oc delete -f ./deploy.yaml
----

=== Set Deploy Time Enforcement to On

You must enable deploy-time enforcement for the `Log4Shell: log4j Remote Code Execution vulnerability` policy.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Platform Configuration -> Policy Management* and find the policy called `Log4Shell: log4j Remote Code Execution vulnerability`.
+
TIP: To find the policy quickly, type `Policy` followed by `Log4Shell` into the filter bar on the *Policy Management* page.

. Select the policy by clicking the three dots to the right and select `Edit policy`.
. Use the `Policy Behavior` tab and enable runtime enforcement by clicking the `inform and enforce button` under `Response Method`
. Scroll down to `Configure enforcement behavior` and switch both the `Enforce on Build` and `DEnforce on Deploy` selectors to on. 
. Click *Review Policy* on the left and *Save*.

+
. Redeploy the vulnerable image
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f ./deploy.yaml
----
+
. Examine the output and note that the Deployment failed to start:
+

.Sample Output

Error from server (Failed currently enforced policies from StackRox): error when creating "./deploy.yaml": admission webhook "policyeval.stackrox.io" denied the request:
The attempted operation violated 1 enforced policy, described below:

Policy: Log4Shell: log4j Remote Code Execution vulnerability
- Description:
    ↳ Alert on deployments with images containing the Log4Shell vulnerabilities
      (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046). There are flaws in the Java logging library
      Apache Log4j in versions from 2.0-beta9 to 2.15.0, excluding 2.12.2.
- Rationale:
    ↳ These vulnerabilities allows a remote attacker to execute code on the server if
      the system logs an attacker-controlled string value with the attacker's JNDI
      LDAP server lookup.
- Remediation:
    ↳ Update the log4j libary to version 2.16.0 (for Java 8 or later), 2.12.2 (for
      Java 7) or later. If not possible to upgrade, then remove the JndiLookup class
      from the classpath: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar
      org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class
- Violations:
    - CVE-2021-44228 (CVSS 10) (severity Critical) found in component 'log4j' (version 2.14.1) in container 'log4shell'
    - CVE-2021-45046 (CVSS 9) (severity Critical) found in component 'log4j' (version 2.14.1) in container 'log4shell'


In case of emergency, add the annotation {"admission.stackrox.io/break-glass": "ticket-1234"} to your deployment with an updated ticket number
----
+
[CAUTION]
====
You might get a different message, detailed below.
RHACS has not yet scanned the image, and is blocking unscanned images from deployment.
If that is the case, simpley run the `oc create -f ./deploy.yaml` again and it will have scanned the image.
Now the deployment will trigger the log4j violations above.
----
Error from server (Failed currently enforced policies from StackRox): error when creating "./deploy.yaml": admission webhook "policyeval.stackrox.io" denied the request:
The attempted operation violated 1 enforced policy, described below:

Policy: Images with no scans
- Description:
    ↳ Alert on deployments with images that have not been scanned
- Rationale:
    ↳ Without a scan, there will be no vulnerability information for this image
- Remediation:
    ↳ Configure the appropriate registry and scanner integrations so that StackRox can
      obtain scans for your images.
- Violations:
    - Image in container 'log4shell' has not been scanned


In case of emergency, add the annotation {"admission.stackrox.io/break-glass": "ticket-1234"} to your deployment with an updated ticket number
