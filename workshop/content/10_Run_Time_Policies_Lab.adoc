== Introduction to {labname}

In this lab, you explore the real-time capabilities of Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) policies after containers are started.
Runtime policies meet requirements for threat detection and prevention, as well as incident investigation and response.

.Goals
* Understand runtime policy enforcement features
* Prevent execution of package manager binary
* Report and resolve violations

[[labexercises]]

== Runtime Policy Features

RHACS observes the processes running in containers, and collects this information to write policies.
This information can also be used to create baseline policy configurations that can be updated by the user.

This allows the user to quickly assess and address novel situations.

=== Clean Up Blocking Policies

The `No bash allowed` policy from lab 3 will block this lab, so you must delete it.

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Platform Configuration -> System Policies* and find the `No bash allowed` policy.
+
[TIP]
====
On the *System Policies* page, type `bash` into the filter bar at the top.
====

. Select the policy name to open the side panel.
. Click *Edit* and click *Next*, and then click *Next* on the two panels that follow to arrive at the *Enforcement* page.
. Click the *ON* switch for runtime enforcement.
. Click *Save*.


=== Prevent Execution of Package Manager Binary

Package managers like `apt` (Ubuntu), `apk` (Alpine), or `yum` (RedHat) are binary software components used to manage and update installed software on a Linux^(R)^ host system.
They are used extensively to manage running virtual machines. But using a package manager to install or remove software on a running container violates the immutable principle of container operation.

This policy demonstrates how RHACS detects and avoids a runtime violation, using Linux kernel instrumentation to detect the running process and OpenShift^(R)^ to terminate the pod for enforcement.

Using OpenShift to enforce runtime policy is preferable to enforcing rules directly within containers or in the container engine, as it avoids a disconnect between the state that OpenShift is maintaining and the state in which the container is actually operating.
Further, because a runtime policy may detect only part of an attacker's activity inside a container, removing the container avoids the attack.

=== Enable Enforcement of Policy

.Procedure
. Navigate to *Platform Configuration -> System Policies* and find the `Ubuntu Package Manager Execution` policy.
+
[TIP]
====
On the *System Policies* page, type `Ubuntu` into the filter bar at the top.
====

. Select the policy name to open the side panel.
. Click *Edit* and click *Next*, and then click *Next* on the two panels that follow to arrive at the *Enforcement* page.
. Click the *ON* switch for runtime enforcement.
. Click *Save*.

=== Test Policy

In this section, you use `tmux` to watch OpenShift _events_ while running the test, so you can see how RHACS enforces the policy at runtime.

.Procedure
. On your student VM, start `tmux` with two panes:
+
[source,sh]
----
tmux new-session \; split-window -h \; split-window -v \; attach
----
+
. Run a watch on OpenShift events in the first shell pane:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get events -w
----
+
. Type `Ctrl-b o` to switch to the next pane.
. Run a temporary Ubuntu OS image using the `tmp-shell` application:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc run tmp-shell --labels="app=tmp-shell" --rm -i --tty --image ubuntu:18.04 -- /bin/bash
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
root@tmp-shell:/#
----
+
After the cluster pulls the image and starts the pod, expect to see a Linux command shell as shown.

. Run the package manager in this shell:
+
[source,sh]
----

root@tmp-shell-65c98c7766-66fpw:/# apt update
----
+
. Examine the output and expect to see that the package manager performs an update operation:
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]

. Examine the `oc get events` tmux pane, and note that it shows that RHACS detected the package manager invocation and deleted the pod:
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options="nowrap"]

After about 30 seconds, you can see that the pod is deleted.

. In your `tmux` shell pane, note that your shell session has terminated and that you are returned to the student VM command line:

== Report and Resolve Violations

At this point, any attacker using a shell to install software is now disconnected from the environment.
A complete record of the event is available on the *Violations* page.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the *Violations* page.
. Find the violation labeled `tmp-shell` and select the `Ubuntu Package Manager Execution` policy.

. Explore the list of the violation events:
+
image::images/rhacs_runtime_violations_tmp-shell.png[RHACS run time Violations]
+
If configured, each violation record is pushed to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) integration, and is available to be retrieved via the API.
The forensic data shown in the UI is recorded, including the timestamp, process user IDs, process arguments, process ancestors, and enforcement action.
+
For more information about integration with SIEM tools, see the RHACS help documentation on link:https://docs.openshift.com/acs/3.68/welcome/index.html#integrating-with-other-products[external tools^].
+
After this issue is addressed--in this case by the RHACS product using the runtime enforcement action--you can remove it from the list by marking it as `Resolved`.

. Hover over the violation in the list to see the resolution options:

== Summary

In this lab, you learned some of the unique features of runtime policy enforcement.
This includes process monitoring and pod deletion based on your specified criteria.
